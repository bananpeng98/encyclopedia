#+RESULTS:

* Spatial SIR simulation
This is an investigation into a model similar to the SIR model. The difference
is that it takes spatial effects into account by simulating individual
interacting agents on a lattice. The next section will describe each part of the
simulation in detail.

** Random walk
The are multiple ways of doing a random walk on a lattice. In this simulation we
will use the /von Neumann neighborhood/ for movement, which means the agents can
only move; up, down, left, right. Each agent can also stay still with
probability $1-d$, where $d$ is the /diffusion rate/.
